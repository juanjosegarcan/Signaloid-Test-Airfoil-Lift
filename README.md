# Airfoil Lift Model in C - Signaloid Cloud Platform
This repository contains a simple C implementation of a model that calculates the lift force generated by an airfoil, based on the Bernoulli equation. The program runs on the Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform, simulating real-world physical parameters such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, and elevation to estimate lift.

## Problem Description
The goal is to calculate the lift generated by an airfoil based on the Bernoulli principle. The model includes various parameters that introduce uncertainties. The uncertainties are represented by uniform and non-uniform distributions. These parameters include:

- Wind speed (measured using a Pitot tube) $v$
- Ambient temperature $T$
- Relative humidity $RH$
- Altitud $h$

The model estimate the lift force for an airfoil using these parameters and the appropriate equations of fluid dynamics.

## How the Model Works
The basic principles of the model are based on Bernoulli's equation, which relates pressure differences to velocity changes in a fluid. The lift is calculated using:

$L = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C_{L} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot v^2$

Where:
- $L$ is the lift force,
- $C_{L}$ is the lift coefficient (which can depend on the angle of attack),
- $\rho$ is the air density (which varies with temperature, pressure, and altitude),
- $A$ is the reference area of the airfoil,
- $v$ is the airspeed (calculated from Pitot tube data).

### Density model 
The simplified model for air density can be approximated using the Ideal Gas Law and humidity correction factors. 

$\rho = \frac{P_0}{R_d \cdot T(h)} \cdot (1-0.378 \cdot RH)$

Where: 
- $P_0=101325 Pa$ is the standard pressure at sea level.
- $R_d = 287.05 \frac{J}{kgK}$ is the specific gas constant for dry air.

and $T(h)$ is the ambient temperature at computed as:

$T(h) = T - TR \cdot h$

Where: 
- $TR$ is the temperature lapse rate, which represents how much the temperature drops per meter of altitude typically with values betweeen 0.006 and 0.007 $\frac{K}{m}$

## Assumptions
- The lift coefficient $C_{L}$ is assumed to be constant for simplicity, though in a more complex model it could vary with the angle of attack: $C_{L} = 1.2$ (typical for moderate angles of attack).
- The airfoilâ€™s geometry and properties are assumed to be known and fixed: $A = 30 m^2$
- Wind speed is an uniform distribution from Pitot tube data: $v =  [60, 120] \frac{m}{s}$.
- Temperature is gaussian distribution with a mean of 300 K and a standard deviation of 2 K. $T = 300 \pm 2 K$
- Humidity is an uniform distribution from 40% to 60%: $RH = [0.4, 0.6]$
- Altitud is an uniform distribution from 3000m to 9000m: $h = [3000, 9000] m$
